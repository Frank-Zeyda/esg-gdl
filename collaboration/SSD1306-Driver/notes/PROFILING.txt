Resource analysis for the demo program:

- 1280 bytes program memory (flash) for the glcdfont[] array
-   26 bytes program memory (flash) for the OLED_INIT_CMDS[] array
-  582 bytes program memory (flash) for actual program code
-   32 bytes of static RAM (SRAM) for strings (demo)

-> SRAM use for heap data is effectively zero.

The Wire and TWI AVR components take away about 8% of program memory
and 10% of SRAM. I am sure by reimplementing those libraries for our
purposes, we can reduce the overhead in memory requirements if needed.
